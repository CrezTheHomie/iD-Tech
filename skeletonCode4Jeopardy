		Take in user input for the row and column that they want to answer (we are using questionCol and questionRow for the variables for this)
		print out the string question of the array. E.G. cout << myArray[row][col] << endl;
		
		use conditional statements to compare the user's answer to the answer array. 
		if it is the same, add points. Otherwise, take away from the point total.
		Update the questions answered variable by one.
